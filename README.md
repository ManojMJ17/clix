# 🐧 clix — AI-Powered Linux Command Helper

**clix** is an AI-powered CLI tool that helps Linux users translate natural language queries (like  
`delete all .tmp files older than 30 days`) into the exact shell command — with explanations, safe execution, and multiple AI backends.

✨ Perfect for beginners who struggle with commands, and a productivity booster for pros.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow / Architecture

1. **User Input**  
   - User types a natural language query into `clix`.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     clix "find all .png files modified in the last 7 days"
     ```

2. **Backend Selection**  
   - `clix` automatically checks available backends in this order:  
     1. **Ollama (local AI)** → Runs locally if installed (privacy-first).  
     2. **Cloud AI (Hugging Face / Groq)** → Used if API keys are configured.  
     3. **Offline Mode** → Falls back to local JSON command database.  

3. **Command Generation**  
   - The selected backend generates the corresponding Linux command.  

4. **Explanation & Preview**  
   - The tool shows the suggested command with an explanation.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     ⚡ Suggested Command: find ~/ -name "*.png" -mtime -7
     ℹ️ Explanation: This finds all PNG files modified in the last 7 days.
     ```

5. **Execution Options**  
   - User can choose to:  
     - ✅ Run the command immediately  
     - 📋 Copy the command only  
     - ❌ Cancel without running  

6. **Result Display**  
   - If executed, the command runs and displays output in the terminal.
